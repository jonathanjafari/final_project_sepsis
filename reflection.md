# Reflection

Working through this design forced me to think about sepsis prediction in a much more practical way than I expected. I’ve spent time with the modeling side in other endeavors, but laying out how the entire pipeline would run in the cloud made me pay attention to things I normally take for granted, like where data lands first, how often something should run, and what belongs in a database versus a warehouse. In that sense, I feel most confident about the overall flow of the system. The big picture—data arriving in Cloud Storage, a job cleaning and shaping it, a simple model scoring it, and a dashboard pulling everything together—makes intuitive sense, and it mirrors what I’ve seen in real hospital data environments.

Where I feel less certain is in the deeper operational details that a production system would need. For example, I know conceptually that service accounts, private networking, and IAM boundaries are essential when PHI is involved, but translating those ideas into an airtight configuration would take more experience. The same is true for model monitoring. In this design, the scoring step is straightforward, but a real sepsis model would need ongoing tracking for drift, calibration changes, alert fatigue, and unit-specific performance. Those are issues I’m aware of, but I can’t say I’m fully confident in how to implement them at scale.

I did consider a few different architectures before settling on the current one. One idea was to run everything on a single VM—ETL scripts, the Flask app, even a small database. While that approach would technically work, I decided against it because it felt too brittle and too far removed from what we’ve practiced in this course. A VM would require constant upkeep, patching, and manual monitoring. I also thought about skipping Cloud SQL entirely and keeping everything in BigQuery. That would simplify things, but BigQuery isn’t great for the quick, repeated small queries that a dashboard might make, so the hybrid approach just felt more natural.

If I had another month or two (and more credits), there is quite a lot I would add. I’d like to actually build out the full prototype so the pipeline runs end-to-end with real Cloud Functions and a working dashboard on Cloud Run. It would also be interesting to layer in basic model monitoring—things like score distributions over time or alert volume patterns—which would make the system feel closer to something a hospital could pilot. And if I had even more time, I’d experiment with making the dashboard a bit more clinician-friendly by adding trend visualizations or simple explanations of why a patient’s score changed. Those additions aren’t necessary for this assignment, but they would make the project feel more complete and more aligned with how sepsis alerts are used in practice.
